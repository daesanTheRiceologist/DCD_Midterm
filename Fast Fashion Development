   <h2>Fast Fashion Development</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Fast fashion brands optimize their supply chains in order to design and manufacture fast, 
            low-cost garments that follow trends and appeal to mainstream consumers at lower prices. 
            Because low-cost garments are mass-produced, the quality is relatively much poorer.
